            My name is Maurice and I’m a game programmer.<br>
            I am currently studying at the Cologne Game Lab after finishing a bachelors degree in electrical engineering.<br>
            For me creating games is the perfect combination of creativity and logic. I love creating gameplay systems.<br>
            While I am using Unity3D for most of my projects, I have worked with Unreal for half a year and I also have experience in coding and tutoring C++.<br>

          <p><b>Game Description: </b>“We live in a universe of freedom and peace. Glued together by a power, an almighty power. But like everything old and lasting, it’s meant to break. Now the days of fear have come, and our cube will collapse. Thus, I have gathered you, my team.” -the Boss<br>

            The K.U.P.E team is a team of special mechanics that is sent into the almighty cube to repair it. They have the task to collect all the Items, which will form a special tool needed for the reparation. Unfortunately, the Items are spread all over the 6 sides of the cube and must be collected! But before diving into the danger of portals, spikes and moving platforms the team needs a special training, in which the four or less players are trained to interact with each other as well as using their characters’ unique abilities to master the sides! Grab your best mates, choose your favourite character and get prepared for the cube!<br>
            
            After the universe is saved once, new records in being the fastest K.U.P.E team ever can be set in the “Run Mode”, in which only the 6 main levels are played, and the overall time is counted!
            <br><br><b>What I worked on: </b> I took care of the complete programming, including local multiplayer, a level editor and character abilities. Additionaly I created the soundtrack for this game.

          <p> <b>Game Description: </b> Glennthrìghde, or as they prefer to call themselves, Glenn, is a Fae, but their goal is to live among
            humans. Except that part where they tried it, and it didn’t work, because Fae simply don’t work like humans,
            especially when it comes to emotions. Now Glenn is trying to fix that using their ability to steal emotions
            for themselves as long as other people feel these emotions. The player controls Glenn in their dream world,
            interacts with humans who are trapped in there and solves puzzles to find memories that Glenn can use to
            evoke certain emotions to steal them.<br>

            Except that part where being human is not as easy as Glenn always thought. It’s a game about emotions and
            the denial of emotions, of past regret and pretending, and about how sometimes you have to feel painful
            things to be human and alive.<br>

            <br><br><b>What I worked on: </b>In this project I worked on the dialog system using Articy Draft and general gameplay features. Furthermore I created some shaders for moving backgrounds and an adaptive soundtrack for both levels of the game.

          <p><b>Game Description: </b>Corruption is a board game enhanced with the use of an app. Your spaceship broke and now you search through
            this old shipwreck you found luckily but something is weird. Time seems to be working differently here and
            what is up with this plants growing everywhere?
            <br><br><b>What I worked on: </b> In this project I took care of the app accompanying the board game. This included experimenting with an own dialog system, networking between the phones of each player and dealing with a lot of data.

          <p><b>Game Description: </b>aaAdventrue is an arcade game collection that features 4 little games, which focus on your microphone as the only input control! All you need is a working microphone and your beautiful voice. There is not much to say, just jump right in and start experimenting with your voice, different instruments or simply scream at your screen! Since it is not only incredibly fun to play, but also incredibly fun to watch people play, you might also want to stream or record your performance!


            <br><br><b>What I worked on: </b> For this game I took care of the input system using the microphone. Generating useful information from the pitch and volume data. I shared the gamplay programming with another programmer. For this project I also took care of the soundtrack for each level.
